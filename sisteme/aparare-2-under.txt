1D (9-14 in 1st/2nd, 8-17 in 3rd/4th; 4S; no 4H; either 4144, a 6 card minor or {a 5 card minor and a singleton or void})
  1H/S/NT = natural
  X=short spades, partner should respond even after [1D]-X-[1S]

  X points, 2S a good hand with a minor, 3m natural, 3M asks for stop in THAT suit

against 3H (9-14, )
  3S a good hand with a minor
  4m natural
  3NT natural


against 1Cl (15+ in 1st/2nd, 18+ in 3rd/4th)
